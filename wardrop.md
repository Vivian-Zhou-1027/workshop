"Top-Down" disaggregation uses areal unit representations and disaggregates them to more to spatially refined distributions. In the case of population disaggregation, this method utilizes "covariate" data by defining a functional relationship between population density and mapped ancillary data. Examples of top-down census disaggregation include the porpotional allocation of population counts to grid cells within each administrative area--the Gridded Population of the World--and the alocation of population counts based on covariates known to correlation with population density--LandScan 1998. Top-down disaggregation allows for recent census data to be linked with accurate digital boundary data, but one challenge of this method is the reliability of input population data from national censuses. 

"Bottom-up" population estimation utilizes complete counts of populations within small, defined areas. This bypasses the need for a full national census and allows for data to be collected accurately for areas without the need for national population data or housing census data. However, the bottom-up approach is tedious and data collected using these methods must be collected and interpreted with "care" and "rigor".

Both the "top-down" and "bottom-up" methods are used to produce population estimates. The primary difference between the two methods is the data used to produce each estimate. The "top-down" method uses areal unit represetentations and disaggregates them into spatially refined distributions, whereas the "bottom-up" creates population estimates without national population and housing census data.
