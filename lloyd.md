The geospatial datasets the authors use in their methodology consist of taking non-spatial population data and "spatially explicit administrative boundary data" to separate population into grid cells using "an areal-weighing method". Additionally, data about land coverage and settlements improve the accuracy of "national scale gridded population data." This is an improvement compared to the convetional census because this effort takes into account more "covariates" or the distribution of humans on a landscape. This method also utilizes "raster topography data", which consists of pixels of a specific size and (x, y) location and is data such as digital aerial pictures and images from satellites, as well as "vector country boundary data"
