## Workshop

1. [Path of an Amazon Truck Driver](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/Path_of_an_Amazon_Truck.png) (Feb.2)

## Project 1

1. [Administrative Subdivisions of Papua New Guinea](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/png.png)(Feb.20)
   This is a map of Papua New Guinea with administrative level 1 and 2 labeled.
2. [Population of Papua New Guinea Extracted from a Raster](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/png_pop19.png)(Feb.20)
   This is a map of Papua New Guidea that contains the country's population density. 
3. [Geometric Bar Plot with my Simple Feature Object](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/Papua_plots.png)(Feb.20)
   This is the project 1 individual deliverable. It is a map that illustrates of the population density of Papua New Guinea in 2019 with a bar plot of each first administrative district's population as a percent of the total population. I did not produce any of the stretch goals for Papua New Guinea because I spent the first two weeks of class trying to subset China, which later became too difficult. I did manage to create a plot of Xinjiang, China--which was part of the individual stretch goal 2 in part 1 of project 1. Following the instructions in github worked well for Papua New Guinea, so I did not have to make many changes nor did I encounter many obstacles. Papua New Guinea's population is concentrated in the northern part of the nation. However, the capital of Papua New Guinea, Port Moseby, is one of the less populated areas. This is because the capital was placed here to benefit white colonizers, since it was the primary port for trade. The majority of the indigenous population lives in the highlands, which is the most populated areas, according to my maps. 
4. [Xinjiang, China Stretch Goal](https://github.com/ixdifulvio/workshop/blob/master/china1.png)(Feb.21)
